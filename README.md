# Dominos_PowerBI_Dashboard_Project
This project analyzes Domino’s sales performance over the past decade, focusing on revenue growth, profitability, and customer trends. By examining historical data and regional patterns, the dashboard provides clear insights into Domino’s financial health and key drivers of its success in the competitive food industry.

🔍 To begin, I explored the Screener website, a fantastic platform for analyzing financial statements and extracting data. I sourced the past years of Domino's data, including Profitability, Order Date, Price, Pizza Size, etc.

📝 After extracting the data, I imported it into Excel, where I performed essential cleaning operations to focus on the necessary information. I meticulously crafted custom time calculations using DAX, allowing for a detailed analysis of order patterns. This helped identify the peak times for maximum and minimum orders, providing valuable insights into customer behavior.

💻 Data Engineering & Modeling: After preparing the data, I loaded it into Power BI and created interactive relationships between dimension and fact tables. This made the dataset dynamic and ready for in-depth analysis, enabling powerful insights with ease. 

📈 Reports Created:
I recently built this dashboard to analyze Domino's sales performance:
🔹 Total Revenue: $818K
🔹 Total Orders: 21K
🔹 Average Order Value: $38

Key insights:
Peak Order Time: 6-7 PM
Top-Selling Pizza: Barbecue Chicken Pizza
Top Revenue Days: Friday & Saturday
Using custom DAX calculations, we’ve identified the busiest times and order trends, helping Domino's make data-driven decisions to optimize sales and operations.
